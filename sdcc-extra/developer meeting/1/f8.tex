	\frametitle{Lessons learned - big picture}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An efficient stackpointer-relative addressing is essentiakl for reentrant functions
		\item A unified address space is essential for efficient pointer access
		\item Registers help
		\item Hardware multithreading can replace peripheral hardware, but it needs good support for atomics, and thread-local storage
		\item Irregular architectures can be very efficient with tree-decomposition-based register allocation
		\item A good mixture of 8-bit and 16-bit operations helps
		\item Pointers should be 16 bits
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Lessons learned - details}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Zero-page, etc addressing isn't useful if we have efficient stackpointer-relative addressing
		\item A index-pointer-relative read instruction for both 8 and 16 bits is important
		\item Prefix bytes can be a good way to allow more operands (e.g. registers)
		\item Hardware $8 \times 8 \to 16$ multiplication helps
		\item Division is rare
		\item Multiply-and-add helps speeds up wider multiplications
		\item BCD support provides cheap printf without need for hardware division
		\item Good shift and rotate support helps
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Where do we get}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Irregular CISC architecture
		\item The core becomes bigger than for RISC, but we save so much on code memory that it is worth it
		\item Approx. 30\% lower code size than stm8 - in current very early experimental SDCC backend
	\end{itemize}
